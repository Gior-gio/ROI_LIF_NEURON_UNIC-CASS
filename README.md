This project proposes the integration of a modular spiking neuron for implementation in MOSbius, targeting the 2025 Chipathon. The proposed architecture uses a low-pass filter realized via a time-domain integrator based on a ring-oscillator VCO, in addition to a comparator and an output spike generation circuit, just as shown in the figure below:
